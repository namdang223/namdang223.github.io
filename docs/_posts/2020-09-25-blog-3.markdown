<p>Starting off with the week, nothing was due the week prior so I had plenty of time to recollect and relax. Coming in with a fresh and healthier mindset, I was able to get a lot of work done. To start off, I decided to work on my website design project for my Comp 484 class. I was task to design a website of any kind to my liking and I decided to do it on my top 3 music artist. I had many errors but you have to make mistakes in order to learn. Some of the errors I ran into was making a proper table and creating the proper padding for the page.</p>

<p>So for the table I used the command <code style="background-color: grey">&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;</code>. What this does is that it creates a table with a 1 pixel border which is the lines around the table. Changing the value from 1 to a bigger number will thicken the size of the border.The cellspacing and cellpadding makes it so that everything is compact and aligned to the way I like. I had to play around with the table for a bit because I did not understand how to do it. This is what my table output looked like on my website:

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <caption>
        <h2>Track Listing</h2>
        </caption>
    
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Track</th>
          <th scope="col">Title</th>
          <th scope="col">Producers</th>
          <th scope="col">Length</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="center">
            <div tabindex="1">1</div> <!--The tabindex attribute creates an index number for items inside of the table that can be cycled through with the tab key. I use it to chronologically cycle through each song on the album-->
          </td>
          <td class="center">Intro</td>

<p>  
One of my main problem I had with this table is using the attribute <code style="background-color: grey">&lt;div tabindex="1"&gt;</code>. The purpose of this attribute is to chronologically list each index with the tab button. When I press the tab key, a highlighted box will automatically start from index number one and chronologically move down the table. At first I did not know how to use the tabindex attribute but after 15 minutes of googling, I realized I had to use the <code style="background-color: grey">&lt;div&gt;</code>tag. I was using the attribute inside of the table header and I was wondering why it was not working but I prevailed and eventually solve that issue.</p>
  
  <p>Here is the link to <a href= "https://namdang-p1.glitch.me/" title="home" class="toprowcolor">my website</a>. For the most part, the website is almost completed. I just need to add little minor things like changing the fonts and adding comments to explain what certain lines do. The website took me awhile to complete but after hours of grinding it through, I came out notorious. This is it for this weeks blog. Catch me on the next for more CSUN updates.
