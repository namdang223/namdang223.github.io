In this week's blog I am going to be go over how to set up AWS Trusted Advisor. AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor also checks help optimize your AWS infrastructure, increase security and performance, reduce your overall costs, and monitor service limits. Now lets get straight to it!

<br><br>
Starting off, you will need to go to your AWS Trusted Advisor Dashboard. This can be done by simply typing into the search box at the top <code style="background-color: grey">"Trusted Advisor"</code>. You will now be on the Trusted Advisor Dashboard. There are five different categories: Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, and Service Limits. In each of these different categories, you can modify and change the available settings to your preferences. Change each of the five categories to whatever you want or if you are lazy, you can keep it on default but you may be missing out on some of the features that AWS Trusted Advisor offers.

With all your settings configured to your liking, what you want to do now is go to the <code style="background-color: grey">Preference</code> tab on the right and allow weekly email notifications so that AWS Trusted Advisor will send you reports of your results and cost-saving estimates. Check off <code style="background-color: grey">Billing Contact</code> and enter in the email you want to have your results sent to. Click <code style="background-color: grey">Save Email Preferences</code> at the bottom and your AWS Trusted Advisor should be all set up and ready to send you your results on a weekly basis.
